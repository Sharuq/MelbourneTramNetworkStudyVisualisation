# A Study on Melbourne Metropolitan Tram Network

R shiny web application on study of Melbourne metropolitan tram network considering tram frequency and average passenger load analysis.
This narrative visualisation conveys the results of service level evaluation study on Melbourne metropolitan tram network and helps to make decisions for optimization of different tram routes. Provides an overview on frequency and average load on different tram routes during AM and PM peak periods.

Through this project I have analyzed the data and tried to find solutions for below questions:

~ How do tram frequencies change with days of the week, time of the day?

~ How do tram passenger load changes with time of the day per route? Which is the busiest route? 

~ Are there any routes which can be optimized for more efficiency?

The project utilizes, May 2017 General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) feeds and passenger load survey data as data sources.
